			<p>  Being me is quite interesting. Funny, having a Bachelor's Degree in Accounting but not liking accounting per say. I enjoy numbers and analysis more than simple journal entries and month/year end balance sheets statements of, well, existing balances.  I like the forensics of things.  The why and how; what drives this, (i.e.) and can it be manipulated.</p>

			<p>  Also, similar in as an Accountant being a label or title, I am a PADI (Professional Association of Diving Instructors) Certified Rescue Diver.  Strangely similar analogy in that I've never rescued anyone, or anything, well, save my jack russel 'Dave'.  Who was terrified of my pool till I lowered him in it.  I say lowered because if you held him over the water he would actually start paddling before being wet.  Hilarious.</p>
